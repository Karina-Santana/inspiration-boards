## Plan

- Create all tables for database. One for users, other for boards and other for images. The relation between them is basically one to many, so I can access the user ID and the board ID. 

- Create the HTML elements.

- Create the basic operations (CRUD) for the whole application: get, post, put and delete requests allowing the user signing up, logging in, logging out, creating boards, editing boards, adding pictures and deleting pictures and boards.


# Future Improvements

- Use an API to allow users to search pictures and add them to their inspiration boards just clicking a button.

- Improve CSS.
